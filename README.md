## Trying out MongoDb


# Overview
This project uses a NoSql database with MongoDb. Database transactions are done RESTfully using Spring Data Mongo. This project is able to still take advantage of hibernate despite having a non relational database through the Hibernate OGM frame work. All API Routes have been tested on Postman.
